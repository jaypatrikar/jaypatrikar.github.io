In total, TartanAviation provides 3.1M images, 3374 hours of Air Traffic Control speech data, and 661 days of ADS-B trajectory data.

Unfortunately, however, most existing robotic systems have been constrained - having been designed for specific tasks, trained on specific datasets, and deployed within specific environments. These systems usually require extensively-labeled data, rely on task-specific models, have numerous generalization issues when deployed in real-world scenarios, and struggle to remain robust to distribution shifts. Motivated by the impressive open-set performance and content generation capabilities of web-scale, large-capacity pre-trained models (i.e., foundation models) in research fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), we devote this survey to exploring (i) how these existing foundation models from NLP and CV can be applied to the field of robotics, and also exploring (ii) what a robotics-specific foundation model would look like. We begin by providing an overview of what constitutes a conventional robotic system and the fundamental barriers to making it universally applicable. Next, we establish a taxonomy to discuss current work exploring ways to leverage existing foundation models for robotics and develop ones catered to robotics. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions in using foundation models for enabling general-purpose robotic systems. We encourage readers to view our living GitHub repository of resources, including papers reviewed in this survey as well as related projects and repositories for developing foundation models for robotics.","2023-12-15","2024-09-14 19:23:48","2024-09-21 00:02:59","2024-09-14 19:23:02","","","","","","","Toward General-Purpose Robots via Foundation Models","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2312.08782 [cs]","","/Users/jaypatrikar/Zotero/storage/Q2YYCPF2/Hu et al. - 2023 - Toward General-Purpose Robots via Foundation Models A Survey and Meta-Analysis.pdf; /Users/jaypatrikar/Zotero/storage/GLEYXV3I/2312.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2312.08782","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a $20$-meter range, with a minimum error below $1$ meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.","2023-10-24","2024-09-14 19:23:48","2024-09-21 00:02:44","2024-09-14 19:23:05","","","","","","","FoundLoc","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.16299 [cs]","","/Users/jaypatrikar/Zotero/storage/I2BWNVS4/He et al. - 2023 - FoundLoc Vision-based Onboard Aerial Localization in the Wild.pdf; /Users/jaypatrikar/Zotero/storage/624YL53W/2310.html","","","Computer Science - Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2310.16299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed system anticipates and reacts to other aircraft using natural language instructions and can serve as a co-pilot or operate entirely autonomously. We point out the main technical challenges where improvements on current state-of-the-art are needed to enable Visual Flight Rules to fully autonomous aerial operations, bringing insights to these critical areas.

A common safety strategy is to inflate obstacles by hand-defined margins. However, arbitrary static margins often fail in more dynamic scenarios, and using worst-case assumptions is overly conservative for most settings where disturbances over time. In this work, we propose a middle ground: safety margins that adapt on-the-fly. In an offline phase, we use Monte Carlo simulations to pre-compute a library of safety margins for multiple levels of disturbance uncertainties. Then, at runtime, our system estimates the current disturbance level to query the associated safety margins that best trades off safety and performance. We validate our approach with extensive simulated and real-world flight tests. We show that our adaptive method significantly outperforms static margins, allowing the vehicle to operate up to 1.5 times faster than worst-case static margins while maintaining safety.
